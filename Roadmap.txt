This is a list of features to include in the future.

As features are included here, they will be removed and described in more detail
    in the release notes!
    
- A plywood aware extension to the unittest suite or unittest2 suite.
- Declerative view classes which behave like Java Spring controllers,
    eg: they can declare the methods get, post, put, delete, etc...
    and even declare multiples of each and allow the appropriate one
    to be called based on url parameters, and named captured groups!
