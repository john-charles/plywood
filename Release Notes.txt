Version 1.1:

    This is an update to version 1.
    
    New features include:
        
        - Ajax support, in the csrf protection system, using either the 
            X-CSRFTOKEN header, or includeing the csrf token in the root
            of the json object sent to the server from a client side ajax
            request.
            
        - The request.put and request.post properties have been updated
            to support json being sent from the client!
            
        - The multipart/form-data parser has been updated to be more efficient
            and to traverse the date fewer times.
            
    Bugs fixed include:
        
        - Sending multipart/form-data which was broken is now fixed!
    
Version 1:
    
    This is the second version. This project has been seriously refactored.
    The core url processing code remains the same however!
    
    New features include:
    
        - The addition of a 'Wrappers' api, which behaves like django's middleware.
        - The addition of a 'Sessions' api, and the implementation of two simple session
            managers, MemorySessionWrapper, and CookieSessionWrapper. 
            
            As always, security was a concern taken seriously, the CookieSessionWrapper
            uses the "secret_key" to sign all cookie data. While this does not provide
            privacy, the client can view the cookie contents, it does provide a
            guarantee of authenticity of data stored in a cookie session!
            
        - This version also removes the @view decorator, which seemed redundant
            and introduces class based views, a view can extend plywood.views.View
            and implement the __call__(self). 
            
        - Inspired by the ASP.NET C# Framework, mixed with the Django forms
            validation framework this version also introduces the concept of
            View based forms which behave both like django forms and like
            asp forms. 

Version 0:

    This is the initial version of the Plywood Web Framework for Python.
    It's features include:
    
        - WSGI Support
        - A Url Mapping framework
