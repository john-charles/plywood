What is 'plywood'?
    
    plywood is a minimalist web framework written in python. Its goal is to
    provide an abstraction over the WSGI interface specification and limited
    other web tools. It is deliberatly designed to not include any database
    or template rendering code. plywood let's you handle web requests, both
    post and get, upload and stream files and provides basic csrf protections.
    
Why did I create 'plywood'?
    
    I created plywood because I was becoming tired of Django and its
    monolithic nature. I wanted to use sql alchemy or other ORM solutions
    for my databse managment and I wanted to use Jinja2 or other template
    languages for rendering my html. This left me with still needing to use
    Django, and install all of it's dependencies.
    
    The goal of plywood is to mimic parts of django where they pretain to
    request handling but not restrict the user to any particular template
    engine or ORM. As this library developed it was also influenced by some
    of the concepts found in other frameworks which handle forms.
    
Why should I use 'plywood'?
    
    Plywood is a full featured WSGI abstraction. It is also pure python
    and has no dependencies outside of the python standard library. Plywood
    is exceptionally lightweight and very small with an install footprint of
    less than 120KB. Plywood is also fast as I developed it on an old laptop
    and spent lots of time figuring out what seemed to waste time and make a
    cleaner version of that. 
    
How do I use 'plywood'?
    
    A simple implementation of a plywood site comes with this package.
    The files example.py and example_views.py are a working standalone
    test website which should be enough to get you started.
