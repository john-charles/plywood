What is 'plywood'?
    
    plywood is a minimalist web framework written in Python. Its goal is to
    provide an abstraction over the WSGI interface specification and limited
    other web tools. plywood lets you handle web requests, upload and stream
    files and provides basic csrf protections; but leaves the choice of
    ORM and template engine up to you.
    
Why did I create 'plywood'?
    
    I created plywood because I was becoming tired of Django's monolithic
    nature. I wanted to use SQL Alchemy or other ORM solutions for my
    databse managment; I wanted to use Jinja2 or other template languages
    for html rendering. Using Django for this purpouse meant installing
    the full Django framework with all its dependencies and hacking its
    settings.
    
    The goal of plywood is to mimic parts of Django where they pretain to
    request handling but not restrict the user to any particular template
    engine or ORM. 
    
Why should I use 'plywood'?
    
    plywood is a full featured WSGI abstraction. It is also pure Python
    and has no dependencies outside of the Python standard library. plywood
    is exceptionally lightweight and very small with an install footprint of
    less than 120KB.
    
How do I use 'plywood'?
    
    A simple implementation of a plywood site is included with this
    package. The files example.py and example_views.py are a working,
    standalone website which can help you to get started.
